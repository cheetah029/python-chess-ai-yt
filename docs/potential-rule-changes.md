# Potential Rule Changes

This document tracks proposed rule modifications discovered through AI training data analysis and game design discussions. Changes listed here are candidates for implementation after initial data collection with the original rules is complete.

## 1. Tiny Endgame Rule: Bishop Deadlock Fix

### Problem

All observed draws (4 total across random and trained AI data) follow the same "bishop deadlock" pattern: 5-6 non-neutral pieces remain with asymmetric compositions, and the only non-royal attackers are bishops. The tiny endgame rule never activates because the symmetry condition (both sides must have the same piece types, ignoring kings) is not met.

| Draw | White Remaining | Black Remaining | Activates? |
|------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | queen x2, bishop | queen, bishop | No - asymmetric |
| 2 | king, bishop | queen x2, bishop | No - asymmetric |
| 3 | queen x2, king, bishop | queen, bishop | No - asymmetric |
| 4 | queen, king | bishop x2, queen | No - asymmetric |

These positions stall because bishops can only capture reactively (pieces that move from their diagonal), not proactively. They cannot chase down a queen or king. Without rooks or knights to create active threats, no captures occur, and the game drifts until the turn cap.

### Why the current rule misses this

The current activation condition for 5-6 pieces requires both sides to have identical piece types (ignoring kings). This was designed to keep the rule "fair" by only applying to symmetric material. But the stalling problem happens precisely in asymmetric endgames where the remaining pieces structurally cannot capture each other.

### Ideas considered

1. **Remove the symmetry requirement entirely for 5-6 pieces.** Too broad - would activate in positions like king+queen+rook+bishop vs king+bishop where the stronger side has a clear winning plan. The distance count limit of 3 would rush them artificially and could turn won positions into losses.

2. **Scale the distance count limit based on piece mobility.** Complex to implement and hard for players to track.

3. **Add a "free reset" of distance counts.** Delays the problem but doesn't fix the structural inability of bishops to capture.

### Proposed change

Add a third activation clause to the tiny endgame rule:

**Current rule:** No pawns AND (4 or fewer non-neutral pieces OR 6 or fewer non-neutral pieces with same piece types ignoring kings)

**New clause:** OR 6 or fewer non-neutral pieces AND no knights or rooks remain on either side.

This specifically targets endgames where the only non-royal attackers are bishops, which are structurally incapable of resolving the game. If even one knight or rook exists, the position has a piece that can actively hunt royals, so the symmetry check still gates activation.

A royal queen counts as "queen" even while transformed (using the same logic as the existing comparison function). This prevents an exploit where repeatedly transforming the queen into a knight toggles the rule on and off, resetting distance counts and enabling infinite stalling.

## 2. Queen Manipulation: Strengthening Base Form

### Problem

Data from 50 trained AI games shows the base-form queen is severely undervalued:

- The queen has the fewest moves of any piece (286 total, 5.7/game) and second-worst capture rate (4.9%)
- 524 manipulations occurred (10.5/game), but 98.1% were pure repositioning with no direct impact — only 10 resulted in captures (1.9%)
- Only 13.9% of manipulations set up a capture on the player's very next turn
- Average manipulation distance: 2.6 squares (43% move the piece just 1 square)
- The AI transforms away from base form 5.2x more often than reverting (140 vs 27)
- Only 15 of 50 games ever see a reversion to base form

The core issue: manipulation costs a full turn, but the effect evaporates immediately because the target moves freely on its next turn (only restriction: can't return to its previous square). The opponent simply adapts, making manipulation a tempo-neutral action at best.

Meanwhile, transforming into a knight (43% of transformations) or bishop (22%) provides dramatically better mobility and attack power. The immunity to manipulation that base form provides is not enough to offset this — being manipulated as a transformed queen is barely punishing.

### Ideas considered

1. **Increase manipulation range or allow multi-step manipulation.** Doesn't fix the core problem — the target still moves freely afterward regardless of how far it was moved.

2. **Allow manipulation to move the base-form enemy queen.** Makes the immunity problem worse — removes the one remaining incentive to stay in base form. The AI would transform even more aggressively.

3. **Make manipulation a "free action" (half-turn).** Large mechanical change that could make manipulation dominant rather than just viable.

4. **Let manipulation explicitly choose the destination (not limited by piece's own movement).** Combined with the free-movement-afterward problem, this just makes the nudge bigger without making it stickier.

5. **Give the base-form queen a passive aura ability.** Adds a new mechanic entirely, increasing game complexity.

6. **Extend restriction #1 — piece can't return to its previous square for N turns instead of 1.** Simple but limited impact — a displaced piece that can move anywhere else isn't meaningfully disrupted.

7. **Manipulated piece can only move one square on its next turn.** Good effect but mechanically awkward — pieces suddenly gain movement they don't normally have (e.g., a knight moving 1 square instead of radius-2). Feels visually and strategically strange.

8. **Queen can only manipulate to adjacent square, piece frozen afterward.** Too weak — 1 square of displacement is barely meaningful even with a freeze.

9. **Bishop-parallel pin: if the manipulated piece moves, the queen can capture it at its destination.** Has the same timing issue as the freeze (see analysis below). Whether the piece is frozen or pinned, the effect only lasts one opponent turn, and by the time the manipulating player can act, the effect has expired.

### Proposed change (under evaluation)

**The piece cannot move on its next turn, but the queen cannot move it to a square that is in danger (a square where it could be immediately captured if it were the other player's turn).**

The safe-square constraint prevents the obvious exploit of dragging a piece directly into a kill zone. The freeze provides real disruption even though it doesn't directly enable a follow-up capture (see analysis below).

### Analysis: Disruption vs. capture setup

The freeze has a timing gap for direct capture setup:

- Turn N: Manipulate piece to safe square
- Turn N+1: Opponent's turn — piece frozen, they do something else
- Turn N+2: Your turn — you could threaten the piece, but...
- Turn N+3: Opponent's turn — piece is unfrozen, escapes

By the time you create a threat (turn N+2), the freeze has expired (turn N+3). A lasting or delayed freeze would solve this but introduces tracking complexity that is unnatural for a board game.

The proposed rule's strength may instead be **disruption**: removing an enemy piece from play for one critical turn, breaking the opponent's coordination, rather than directly enabling captures. This framing and the rule's full balance implications are still under evaluation.

### Open questions

- Is the disruption framing (tempo/coordination disruption) powerful enough to justify staying in base form, or does manipulation need to enable captures to compete with transformation?
- Can a natural, easy-to-track rule be found that enables the "threaten and the piece can't escape" effect? This would require the freeze/pin to last through the manipulating player's next turn, which inherently needs either a delayed or multi-turn effect.
- Should the queen be able to re-freeze the same piece on consecutive turns? If so, this could create a soft lock. A restriction like "the queen may not manipulate a piece she manipulated on her previous turn" would prevent this.
