"""The methodology itself, enforced.

THE REVIEWER'S OBJECTION, which is correct and goes to the root:

    "I am asking for strict improvement, not overall improvement. If
    even a single thing is worse, the change cannot be shipped. So
    using gates to 'test' for strict improvement is wrong in and of
    itself. What needs to be done from the start is to design the
    methodology of building the change so that it is certainly
    strictly better."

A gate is a DETECTOR. It reports what it can see, at the power it has,
on the phases it reaches. An empty result means "nothing detected",
never "nothing there" -- and this project has three worked examples of
the gap being real: a tempo loss inside the noise floor and down on all
four seeds; an endgame loss invisible on the board being measured; a
gain measured while the change crippled the search.

So every behavioural change that is ON in the player carries a
CERTIFICATE -- an argument made before the measurement, of a shape
whose premise can be checked mechanically. These tests re-check every
premise on every run. A change whose premise stops holding fails here,
not in a reviewer's game.
